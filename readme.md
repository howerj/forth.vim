# Forth Syntax File

This is a Forth syntax file for personal use, it has been modified to work with
my Forth systems, <https://github.com/howerj/libforth>, and
<https://github.com/howerj/forth-cpu>. This is not the official version, which
can be found at <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1564>.
